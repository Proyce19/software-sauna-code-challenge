# Software Sauna Code Challenge Solution
The repository is to be used as a solution for the [Software Sauna Code Challenge](https://github.com/softwaresauna/code-challenge).

The repository has 3 files that will allow the user to run the program in their local machine.

The **path_tracer_sauna_challenge.py** file is the one where the solution is implemented.
In the main part of the program the input is hardcoded. If you want to try to run with different inputs please use the **inputs.txt** file.

The tests for the program can be found in the **test_path_tracer_sauna_challenge.py** file.

To run the program you need a virtual environment with **Python 3.9+** or you can use the one installed on your system.

For the test the **unittest** library is used, so no **requirements.txt** file was necessary.
